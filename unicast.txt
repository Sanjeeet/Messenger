**********************************************************************  UNICAST  **********************************************************************





Implemented private messaging to a specific person whether it'd be across the same session, different session or even for users that aren't in any sessions.


In order for the private message to successfully get across, both the sending and receiving clients need to be logged in. That is the only requirement.


To private message, first, you simply put in the terminal"/unicast" as the command and "<to_client_id>" as the receiving client's id. 
Then you type what you want to message them!
 

/unicast <to_client_id>
THEN,
<message>





For example,
	Sender side:

	/unicast Joon 
	THEN,
	Hi Joon, My name is Joo Hun




	Receiver side (Joon): 

	Joo Hun: Hi Joon, My name is Joo Hun





IF YOU NEED TO LOGIN, WE HARDCODED OUR CLIENTS!!!!:
ID : joon           pw : joon
ID : moon           pw : moon
ID : moo            pw : moo
ID : cow            pw : cow
